  - I looked at Monsieur Fogg 
  *   ... and I could contain myself no longer.
      'What is the purpose of our journey, Monsieur?'
      'A wager,' he replied.
      * *     'A wager!'[] I returned.
              He nodded. 
              * * *   'But surely that is foolishness!'
              * * *  'A most serious matter then!'
              - - -   He nodded again.
              * * *   'But can we win?'
                      'That is what we will endeavour to find out,' he answered.
              * * *   'A modest wager, I trust?'
                      'Twenty thousand pounds,' he replied, quite flatly.
              * * *   I asked nothing further of him then[.], and after a final, polite cough, he offered nothing more to me. <>
      * *     'Ah[.'],' I replied, uncertain what I thought.
      - -     After that, <>
  *   ... but I said nothing[] and <> 
  - we passed the day in silence.
